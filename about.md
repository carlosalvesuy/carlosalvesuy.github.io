I'm Carlos Alves. I'm a photography enthusiast, open source lover, Sysadmin, DevOps, you\_name\_it of Unix like systems, from [Montevideo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montevideo)
- [Uruguay](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay).

## Open Source and Free Software

I am passionate about open source and free software and I think you should be too!
Yes I know, it might be a little harder at the beginning, but you will learn to
love it ^_^
You can learn more about open source [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) and more about free software [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software).

### Weapons of choice

This are some of my preferred tools:

* Text Editor: [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) more recently I started using [Neovim](https://neovim.io/)
* Programming Languages: [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/), [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/). I also have some experience with [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* Code Version Control: [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* Operating System: For my laptop: [Arch Gnu/Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/)
  and for my servers: [FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org/)
* Desktop Environment: I don't really use a full blown desktop environment like
  Gnome or KDE, etc. Instead I use the [Awesome WM](http://awesome.naquadah.org/) with [URxvt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rxvt-unicode) as my terminal emulator.
* Remote Administration: [SSH](http://www.openssh.com/), yes the good ol' SSH,
  you won't belive me how powerful and useful it is.
* Filesystem: [ZFS](http://open-zfs.org/wiki/Main_Page) You gotta love it! You
  can read more about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZFS).

Yes this is only the beginning, but you got an idea.

### Bonus Track

My weapons for Photography are:

* RAW image processing: [Darktable](http://www.darktable.org/)
* Photography publishing: [Koken](http://koken.me/)

## Photography

I am a photography enthusiast and I really love to attend a lot of events
including cosplay, comics, japanese culture, tattoo, dancing and more.
I started into photography back in the 2011 with a tiny [Nikon Coolpix L20](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikon_Coolpix_L20) which is a point and shoot camera. It is a really simple camera but I still love some of the photos I took with it :).
Back in 2012 I got a new camera, a [Nikon Coolpix L110](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikon_Coolpix_L110) another point and shoot  camera and went to my first [ConComics](http://concomics.com/), I've also started to
take photographs of dancing since my sister is a dancer.
Later in 2013 I got a [Nikon D3200](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikon_D3200)
and started to learn even more, and when you start learning you want to apply
what you are learning and you really enjoy it.
Finally at the beginning of 2014 I bought my current camera, a [Nikon D700](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikon_D700).

## Work experience

### Percona

My essential duties and responsibilities at [Percona](http://www.percona.com/about-us/our-team/carlos-alves) were:

Linux Administration including configuration, troubleshooting, and automation
Research and recommend innovative, and where possible automated approaches for system administration tasks.  Identify approaches that leverage our resources and provide economies of scale
Troubleshoot a wide variety of performance, security, and operational issues in the LAMP Stack
Perform daily system monitoring, verifying the integrity and availability of all hardware, server resources, systems and key processes, reviewing system and application logs, and verifying completion of scheduled jobs such as backups
Repair and recover from hardware or software failures. Coordinate and communicate with impacted constituencies
Design, analyze and implement complex Linux based systems that meet our requirements
Perform periodic performance reporting to support capacity planning
Provide peers with expert level advice and knowledge on a wide variety of infrastructure topics
Develop Backend tools that help meet our needs
Participate in OnCall rotation and responsibilities sometimes require working evenings and weekends, sometimes with little advanced notice
Keep documentation up to date

### eXpand

At [Expand](http://www.expand.com.uy/en) I perform the installation/mantainance/configuration support for
Expand servers, which relies on CentOS, Asterisk PBX software and an
inhouse-developed web client as well as a Daemon that acts as middleware
between the web client and Asterisk.
Additionally I develop Asterisk AGIs, mostly python based, and backend monitor
and maintennance scripts. Technologies used are mostly Python for AGIs, system
scripts and Expand's Twisted based daemon middleware, Python and Bash for
maintanance scripts, relying on MySQL for database needs and PHP for the web
client.
